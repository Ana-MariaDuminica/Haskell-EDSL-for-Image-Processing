# Haskell-EDSL-for-Image-Processing
A Haskell project implementing an Embedded Domain-Specific Language (EDSL) for image manipulation, exploring shallow and deep embeddings. It demonstrates functional programming concepts such as polymorphism, lazy evaluation, and type mechanisms, while comparing different representation models for domain-specific operations.
